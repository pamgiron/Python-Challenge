 Week 3 (budget and election data) 


Given two very large and seemingly simple data sets. One that captured budget and another that captured poll data. 

After running the analysis we were able to conclude the number of months included (86), the net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period of time ($22,564,198), and Average change ($ - 8311.11).

We were also able to pull what the greatest increase in profits was and when it happened - Aug 16 ($1,862,002) and what and when the greatest decrease in profit was and happened - Feb-14 ($ - 1,825,558)

Lastly we were able to pull this data into a nicely formatted table to easily understand and view. 

Its important to understand the finacial investment made and comprehend the change, profit and losses. Pulling in the date information could also give us insight into why we saw such big lows and highs during certain months.

The second set of data focused on poll reesults. Here we were asked to evaluate how many votes were cast, the percentage and total value of votes won by each candidate, and the winner by popular vote. 

This is obviously key to understanding what happened during the election. Was it a win by a landslide or a close race? How many unique candiates did we notice. we could look at candiate popularity by county and take things even further and pull in political affiliation to identify if the candidates were a good mix of parties or if they leaned one way or another.
